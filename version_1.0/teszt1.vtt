00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.933
When one chooses to walk
the Way of the Mandalore,

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.349
you are both hunter and prey.

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.475
There is one job.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.524
Underworld?

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:25.784
How uncharacteristic
of one of your reputation.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.031
Is it not the Code of the Guild
that these events are now forgotten?

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.366
A Mandalorian
shot up the Guild on Nevarro,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.409
took some high value target
and went rogue.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.795
Traveling with me,
that's no life for a kid.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.836
They'll keep coming.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:53.972
None will be free
until the old ways are gone forever.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.388
You have something I want.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.938
This is the one
you hunted, then saved?

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.612
Its species
can move objects with its mind.

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:12.407
The songs of eons past tell
of battles between Mandalore The Great,

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.909
and an order of sorcerers called Jedi.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.294
By Creed, it is in your care.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.419
- You must reunite it with its own kind.
- I was a foundling.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.998
The Mandalorians raised me
in the Fighting Corps.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.551
I was treated as one of their own.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.714
- Did you do this?
- No!

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.129
Did any survive?

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.505
We knew what could happen
if we left the covert.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.513
Our secrecy is our survival.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.845
Take care of this little one.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.763
This is the Way.

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.974
I'm here to see Gor Koresh.

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:46.894
Enjoy the fights.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:24.972
Oh!

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.855
You know this is no place for a child.

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.947
Wherever I go, he goes.

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:47.124
So I've heard.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.043
I've been quested
to bring him to his kind.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:56.128
If I can locate other Mandalorians,
they can help guide me.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.755
I'm told you know where to find them.

00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.511
It's uncouth to talk business immediately.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.295
Just enjoy the entertainment.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:17.895
Bah! My Gamorrean's not doing well.
Kill him! Finish him!

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:22.243
Oh!

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.066
Do you gamble, Mando?

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:25.986
Not when it can be avoided.

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.504
Well, I'll bet you
the information you seek

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.830
that this Gamorrean's going to die
within the next minute and a half.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:37.916
And all you have to put up in exchange
is your shiny beskar armor.

00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:42.684
I'm prepared
to pay you for the information.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.469
I'm not leaving my fate up to chance.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.640
Nor am I.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.359
Thank you for coming to me.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:08.954
Normally, I have to seek out remnants
of you Mandalorians in your hidden hives

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:13.206
to harvest your
precious shiny shells.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:16.496
Beskar's value continues to rise.

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.841
I've grown quite fond of it.

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.049
Give it to me now
or I will peel it off your corpse.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.347
Tell me
where the Mandalorians are

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.719
and I'll walk outta here
without killing you.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.056
I thought you said
you weren't a gambler...

00:06:36.772 --> 00:06:37.942
I'm not.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.960
All right, stop, stop!
I'll tell you where he is.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.585
But you must promise
that you won't kill me.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.880
I promise you will not die by my hand.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.761
Now, where is the Mandalorian you know of?

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.894
Tatooine.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.220
What?

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.890
The Mando I know of is on Tatooine.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:59.516
I've spent much time on
Tatooine. I never saw a Mandalorian there.

00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:01.935
My information is good, I tell you.

00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:05.864
The city of Mos Pelgo.
I swear it by the Gotra.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.158
Tatooine it is, then.

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:13.785
Wait, Mando!
You can't leave me like this.

00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:16.082
Cut me down!

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.460
That wasn't part of the deal.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.208
Wait, what are you doing?

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:27.215
Mando! I can pay! Mando! Mando!

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.766
All right. Hey, hey, hey!

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.265
Sorry, gang. Come on.

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.605
You know he doesn't like droids.

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:28.608
May as well let them have at it.

00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:30.574
The Crest needs a good once-over.

00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:33.074
Oh! So he likes droids now.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.326
Well, you heard him. Give it a once-over.

00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:41.746
I guess a lot has changed
since you were last in Mos...

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:45.958
Oh! Thank the Force!

00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:50.917
This little thing has had me worried sick.

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:53.178
Come here, you little womp rat.

00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:57.012
Looks like it remembers me.

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.517
How much do you want for it?
Just kidding. But not really.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.140
You know, if this thing
ever divides or buds,

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.647
I will gladly pay for the offspring.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:05.770
Hey!

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.106
Oh, jeez!

00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:10.691
Watch what you're doing up there.
He barely trusts your kind.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.737
You want to give all droids a bad name?

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.528
Thank you!

00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:17.908
I'm here on business.
I need your help.

00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:19.413
Oh, then, business, you shall have.

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:22.964
Care for me to watch this wrinkled critter
while you seek out adventure?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.880
I've been quested
to bring this one back to its kind.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.299
Oh, wow.
I can't help you there.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.798
I've never seen any like it.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.300
And trust me, I've seen
all shapes and sizes in this town.

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.429
A Mandalorian Armorer
has set me on my path.

00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:39.104
If I can locate another of my kind,

00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.641
I can chart a path
through the network of coverts.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.732
You've been the only Mando here for years
from what I can tell.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.771
Where is Mos Pelgo?
I'm told there's one there.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.978
Oh. Boy, I haven't heard
that name in a while.

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:52.688
It's not on any of the maps.

00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:54.448
Because it was wiped out by bandits.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.570
Once the Empire fell,
it was a free-for-all.

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:58.827
I didn't dare leave the city walls.
Still don't.

00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:01.081
Can you tell me
where it used to be?

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.291
Depends who's asking. You want to see it?

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.745
R-five!
Bring the map of Tatooine.

00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.875
No, take your time. Seriously.

00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:11.712
You just can't get good help anymore.

00:11:11.797 --> 00:11:13.337
I don't even know who to complain to.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:15.965
Let's go, let's go.

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.301
Waiting. Okay.

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:22.101
This is a map of Tatooine before the war.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:27.152
You got Mos Eisley, Mos Espa,
and up around this region, Mos Pelgo.

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:30.818
I don't see anything.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.109
Well, it's there.
Or at least, it used to be.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.323
Not much to speak of.
It's an old mining settlement.

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:39.365
They're going to see that
big hunk o' metal long before you land.

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:43.037
You still have that speeder bike?

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.500
Sure do.
It's a little rusty, but I got it.

00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:09.812
Can I help you?

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:11.602
I'm looking for a Mandalorian.

00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:14.436
Well, we don't get
many visitors in these parts.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.565
Can you describe him?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.690
Someone who looks like me.

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:20.986
Mmm...

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.570
You mean the Marshal?

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.278
Your Marshal
wears Mandalorian armor?

00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:28.155
See for yourself.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.681
What brings
you here, stranger?

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:49.719
I've been searching
for you for many parsecs.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:53.636
Well, now, you found me.
Weequay, two snorts of spotchka.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:01.775
Why don't you join me for a drink?

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.170
I've never met a real Mandalorian.

00:15:27.219 --> 00:15:29.299
Heard stories.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.429
I know you're good at killing.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.984
And probably none too happy
to see me wearing this hardware.

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:39.272
So...

00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:42.484
I figure only one of us
walking out of here.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.994
But then I see the little guy...

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:52.449
...and I think, maybe I pegged you wrong.

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.462
Who are you?

00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:58.539
I'm Cobb Vanth, Marshal of Mos Pelgo.

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.711
Where did you get the armor?

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.174
Bought it off some Jawas.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:05.509
Hand it over.

00:16:08.886 --> 00:16:12.716
Look, pal, I'm sure you call the shots
where you come from,

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:17.436
but 'round here,
I'm the one tells folks what to do.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.648
Take it off.

00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:22.897
Or I will.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.985
We gonna do this in front o' the kid?

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.369
He's seen worse.

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:33.868
Right here, then?

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:35.082
Right here.

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.296
Maybe we can work something out.

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:15.659
That creature's
been terrorizing these parts

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.779
since long before
Mos Pelgo was established.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.037
Thanks to this armor,
I've been able to protect this town

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.410
from bandits and Sand People.

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:24.917
They look to me to protect 'em.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:28.709
But a krayt dragon
is too much for me to take on alone.

00:19:33.966 --> 00:19:36.086
Help me kill it, I'll give you the armor.

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:42.926
Deal. I'll ride back to the ship,
blow it out of the sand from the sky,

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.346
use the bantha as bait.

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:45.852
Not so simple.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.898
The ship passes above,
it senses the vibrations,

00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:49.981
stays underground.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:52.861
But I know where it lives.

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:54.565
How far?

00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:57.815
Not far.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.135
You don't
understand what it was like.

00:20:22.973 --> 00:20:25.183
The town was on its last legs.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.766
It started after we got news
of the Death Star blowing up.

00:20:30.439 --> 00:20:31.689
The second one, that is.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.817
The Empire was pullin' outta Tatooine.

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:40.485
There was blaster fire over Mos Eisley.

00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:44.538
The occupation was over.

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:51.251
We didn't even have time to celebrate.

00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:54.205
That very night,
the Mining Collective moved in.

00:20:57.049 --> 00:21:01.219
Power hates a vacuum and
Mos Pelgo became a slave camp overnight.

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.691
Hey, you okay?

00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:13.982
Come on, let's get you outta here.
Let's go!

00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:17.605
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:33.669
I lit out.
Took what I could from the invaders.

00:21:34.503 --> 00:21:35.843
Grabbed a camtono.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.717
I had no idea
it was full of silicax crystals.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:45.639
I guess every once in a while,
both suns shine on a womp rat's tail.

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.521
I wandered for days.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.744
No food, no water.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.285
And then...

00:22:08.537 --> 00:22:09.867
I was saved.

00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:40.241
The Jawas wanted the crystals.

00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:45.491
They offered their finest in exchange.

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:57.336
And my treasure bought me
more than a full waterskin.

00:23:02.007 --> 00:23:03.797
It bought my freedom.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.850
Get down!

00:23:58.564 --> 00:24:00.074
- Go, go!
- Come on!

00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:01.982
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:39.829
What the hell you doin'?

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.880
Hey, partner,
you want to tell me what's going on?

00:26:28.964 --> 00:26:31.594
They want to
kill the krayt dragon, too.

00:27:36.365 --> 00:27:38.325
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:27:38.408 --> 00:27:39.538
You drink it.

00:27:39.618 --> 00:27:41.078
It stinks.

00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:42.621
Do you want their help?

00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:44.294
Not if I have to drink this.

00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:48.543
He says
your people steal their water

00:27:48.627 --> 00:27:51.087
and now you insult them
by not drinking it.

00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:54.256
They know
about Mos Pelgo.

00:27:54.341 --> 00:27:56.431
They know how many Sand People you killed.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.430
They raided our village.
I defended the town.

00:28:00.514 --> 00:28:01.774
Lower your voice.

00:28:01.849 --> 00:28:04.729
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- You're agitating them.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.650
These monsters can't be reasoned with.

00:28:06.728 --> 00:28:09.108
Sit back down
before I put a hole through ya!

00:28:09.815 --> 00:28:11.185
I'm not going to say it...

00:28:23.704 --> 00:28:25.334
What are you telling them?

00:28:25.414 --> 00:28:27.084
Same thing I'm telling you.

00:28:27.165 --> 00:28:30.335
If we fight amongst ourselves,
the monster will kill us all.

00:28:32.337 --> 00:28:36.257
Now, how do we kill it?

00:29:21.512 --> 00:29:24.062
They say
it lives in there. They say it sleeps.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.600
It lives in an abandoned sarlacc pit.

00:29:30.521 --> 00:29:32.061
Lived on Tatooine my whole life.

00:29:32.147 --> 00:29:35.067
There's no such thing
as an abandoned sarlacc pit.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.360
There is if you eat the sarlacc.

00:29:41.156 --> 00:29:43.696
They're laying out a bantha
to protect the settlement.

00:29:45.118 --> 00:29:48.368
They've studied its digestion cycle
for generations.

00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:51.077
They feed the dragon
to make it sleep longer.

00:29:52.835 --> 00:29:55.415
Watch, the dragon will appear.

00:30:40.924 --> 00:30:42.974
They might
be open to some fresh ideas.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.150
What are the bones?

00:31:01.236 --> 00:31:03.606
That's the krayt dragon.

00:31:03.697 --> 00:31:05.027
And those little rocks?

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:06.405
That's us.

00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:07.491
It's not to scale.

00:31:07.576 --> 00:31:08.696
I think it is.

00:31:10.996 --> 00:31:12.616
Can't be. That's too big.

00:31:20.297 --> 00:31:21.837
It's to scale.

00:31:21.924 --> 00:31:24.934
I've only seen its head and neck.
It's bigger'n I guessed.

00:31:28.514 --> 00:31:30.524
Might be time to rethink our arrangement.

00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:42.991
That's more like it.

00:31:43.612 --> 00:31:45.572
Where are they getting the reinforcements?

00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:47.526
I volunteered your village.

00:32:05.843 --> 00:32:07.853
They attacked us
less than a year ago.

00:32:08.512 --> 00:32:10.682
Killed half a dozen of us
by the mining camp.

00:32:11.598 --> 00:32:14.098
I'd say I took down
about twice as many Tuskens.

00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:19.861
The town respects you.
My guess is, they'll listen to reason.

00:32:21.692 --> 00:32:23.282
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:32:29.199 --> 00:32:31.409
This here is a Mandalorian.

00:32:32.202 --> 00:32:33.452
You know what that means?

00:32:33.912 --> 00:32:35.332
We've heard the stories.

00:32:36.081 --> 00:32:37.831
Then you know
how good they are at killing.

00:32:41.587 --> 00:32:43.007
Now, this one's got a problem.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.380
I got a suit o' salvaged armor

00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:47.715
and the Mandalorian creed says
it's his to take.

00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:52.432
But I've got a problem, too.

00:32:53.515 --> 00:32:56.635
A krayt dragon has been peeling off
our pack animals,

00:32:56.727 --> 00:32:58.647
and sometimes,
taking our mining haul with it.

00:32:59.521 --> 00:33:02.401
It's just a matter of time
before it grows tired of banthas

00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:06.452
and goes after a couple of you townsfolk,
or even, so help us, the school.

00:33:09.072 --> 00:33:12.582
As much as I've grown fond of the armor,
I'm even more fond of this town.

00:33:13.952 --> 00:33:17.582
The Mandalorian is willing
to help us slay the leviathan

00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:22.712
in exchange for returning the armor
to its ancestral owners.

00:33:23.504 --> 00:33:24.634
Well, that settles it.

00:33:24.713 --> 00:33:25.963
There's more.

00:33:27.758 --> 00:33:29.838
We can't take on the krayt alone.

00:33:31.637 --> 00:33:33.597
And the Sand People are willing to help.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:36.850
They raid our mines!

00:33:36.934 --> 00:33:38.064
They're monsters!

00:33:39.394 --> 00:33:41.734
I've seen the size of that thing,

00:33:41.813 --> 00:33:44.823
it will swallow your entire town
when the fancy hits it.

00:33:45.776 --> 00:33:48.316
You're lucky Mos Pelgo
isn't a sand field already.

00:33:50.447 --> 00:33:52.777
I know these people. They are brutal.

00:33:53.492 --> 00:33:54.662
But so is the Dune Sea.

00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:59.211
They've survived
for thousands of years in these sands

00:33:59.748 --> 00:34:02.418
and they know the krayt dragon
better than anyone here.

00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:04.551
They are raiders, it's true.

00:34:05.462 --> 00:34:07.132
But they also keep their word.

00:34:09.216 --> 00:34:10.336
We have struck a deal.

00:34:11.468 --> 00:34:14.678
If we are willing to leave them
the carcass and its ichor,

00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:17.562
they will stand by our side in battle

00:34:17.641 --> 00:34:20.481
and vow never to raise
a blaster against this town

00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:23.151
until one of you breaks the peace.

00:34:33.282 --> 00:34:34.452
Think it'll work?

00:34:34.867 --> 00:34:35.947
It better.

00:34:36.034 --> 00:34:37.914
Joining forces is their only hope.

00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:36.601
Here. Grab this.

00:35:41.892 --> 00:35:44.602
Hey! What are you doin'?
That's an explosive.

00:35:44.686 --> 00:35:46.646
Are you trying to blow the whole place up?

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.110
What? Is that what you want?

00:35:49.191 --> 00:35:51.941
Take it easy. It was an accident, okay?

00:35:52.027 --> 00:35:54.147
- What do you want to do?
- It was an accident.

00:35:57.866 --> 00:36:00.286
- Let's go.
- It's not going to work out.

00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:03.909
It's gonna be great.

00:37:54.149 --> 00:37:55.149
What'd he say?

00:37:56.026 --> 00:37:57.736
He says it's sleeping.

00:37:57.819 --> 00:38:00.409
If we listen carefully,
we can hear it breathing.

00:38:10.916 --> 00:38:12.746
Let's get to work.

00:38:21.593 --> 00:38:24.433
The Tuskens say
the belly is the only weak spot,

00:38:25.472 --> 00:38:27.272
so we have to hit it from below.

00:38:29.518 --> 00:38:32.808
First, we bury the charges
at the opening of the cave.

00:38:35.107 --> 00:38:36.567
Then, we wake it up.

00:38:38.277 --> 00:38:40.527
We have to get it angry enough to charge.

00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:55.838
Once it's far enough out
and the belly is above the explosives,

00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:57.249
you hit the detonator.

00:39:08.765 --> 00:39:09.765
Careful, Marshal.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.020
Thank you, Jo. And you stay safe, huh.

00:40:52.202 --> 00:40:54.042
Dank farrik,
it's going back in.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.180
It's retreating.

00:41:11.763 --> 00:41:13.063
- I'm going to hit it.
- No, wait.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.810
We only have one shot.
We've gotta get it out.

00:41:37.748 --> 00:41:38.828
Now?

00:41:38.916 --> 00:41:41.626
Not yet.
It's gotta come out further.

00:42:24.127 --> 00:42:25.997
Almost, almost.

00:42:27.047 --> 00:42:28.087
Now!

00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:12.216
I don't think it's dead.

00:43:12.968 --> 00:43:13.968
Me either.

00:43:31.195 --> 00:43:32.985
It's picking us off like womp rats.

00:43:34.198 --> 00:43:35.448
Let's get after it!

00:44:02.184 --> 00:44:03.564
This ain't doing a thing.

00:44:03.644 --> 00:44:05.604
Just keep shooting.

00:44:46.728 --> 00:44:47.938
There he is.

00:45:01.535 --> 00:45:03.655
I've got an idea.
Get its attention.

00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:18.261
I got its attention! Now what?

00:45:18.677 --> 00:45:19.967
- Run!
- Go, go.

00:45:20.053 --> 00:45:22.263
You still have
that detonator?

00:45:22.347 --> 00:45:23.767
Take it! What's the plan?

00:45:23.849 --> 00:45:25.389
Take care of the Child.

00:45:25.475 --> 00:45:28.095
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know, but wish me luck.

00:45:39.156 --> 00:45:40.776
No! No, no, no!

00:45:40.866 --> 00:45:42.826
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:47:14.042 --> 00:47:15.542
Yeah!

00:48:04.134 --> 00:48:06.764
Sorry,
I didn't have time to explain.

00:48:07.346 --> 00:48:08.426
No need.

00:48:09.598 --> 00:48:10.928
This was well-earned.

00:48:11.767 --> 00:48:12.887
It was my pleasure.

00:48:14.478 --> 00:48:15.768
I hope our paths cross again.

00:48:16.271 --> 00:48:17.441
As do I.

00:48:17.523 --> 00:48:20.613
Oh, and you tell your people
I wasn't the one that broke that.
